  (Optional) A configuration for `Content-Security-Policy` header in HTTP responses sent from CloudFront. The HTTP `Content-Security-Policy` response header allows web site administrators to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page.

The header allows you to avoid MIME type sniffing by saying that the MIME types are deliberately configured. `content_type_options_header` as defined below.
    (Optional) `enabled` - Whether to enable `X-Content-Type-Options` response header. When this setting is `true`, CloudFront adds the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to response. (Blocks a request if the request destination is of type style and the MIME type is not text/css, or of type script and the MIME type is not a JavaScript MIME type.) Defaults to `false`.

The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>` or `<object>`. Sites can use this to avoid click-jacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites. `frame_options_header` as defined below.

      - `DENY`: The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do
      so.

The `Referrer-Policy` HTTP header controls how much referrer information (sent with the `Referer` header) should be included with requests. Aside from the HTTP header, you can set this policy in HTML. The original header name `Referer` is a misspelling of the word "referrer". The `Referrer-Policy` header does not share this misspelling. `referrer_policy_header` as defined below.
    (Optional) `enabled` - Whether to enable `Referrer-Policy` response header. Defaults to `false`.
    (Optional) `override` - Whether CloudFront overrides the `Referrer-Policy` response header with the header received from the origin. Defaults to `true`.

Valid values are `no-referrer`, `no-referrer-when-downgrade`, `origin`, `origin-when-cross-origin`, `same-origin`, `strict-origin`, `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `unsafe-url`. Defaults to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

variable "strict_transport_security_header" {

  (Optional) A configuration for `Strict-Transport-Security` header in HTTP responses sent from CloudFront. The HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security` response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS. Note: This is more secure than simply configuring a HTTP to HTTPS (301) redirect on your server, where the initial HTTP connection is still vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. `strict_transport_security_header` as defined below.
    (Optional) `enabled` - Whether to enable `Strict-Transport-Security` response header. Defaults to `false`.
    (Optional) `override` - Whether CloudFront overrides the `Strict-Transport-Security` response header with the header received from the origin. Defaults to `true`.
    (Optional) `max_age` - The value for the `max-age` directive of this header. The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS. Defaults to `31536000` (365 days).
    (Optional) `include_subdomains` - Whether CloudFront includes the `includeSubDomains` directive in the value of this header. When this setting is `true`, this rule applies to all of the site's subdomains as well. Defaults to `false`.
    (Optional) `preload` - Whether CloudFront includes the `preload` directive in the header value. However, it is not part of the HSTS specification and should not be treated as official. Defaults to `false`.

  (Optional) A configuration for `X-XSS-Protection` header in HTTP responses sent from CloudFront. The HTTP `X-XSS-Protection` response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. These protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong `Content-Security-Policy` that disables the use of inline JavaScript ('unsafe-inline'). `xss_protection_header` as defined below.
    (Optional) `enabled` - Whether to enable `X-XSS-Protection` response header. Defaults to `false`.
    (Optional) `override` - Whether CloudFront overrides the `X-XSS-Protection` response header with the header received from the origin. Defaults to `true`.
    (Optional) `filtering_enabled` - Whether to enable XSS filtering. The value of `X-XSS-Protection` will be set to `0` (XSS filtering is disabled) or `1` (XSS filtering is enabled). Defaults to `true`.
    (Optional) `block` - Whether to enable `block`, which determines whether CloudFront includes the `mode=block` directive in the header value. Defaults to `false`.
    (Optional) `report` - A reporting URI (in the `report` field), which determines whether CloudFront includes the `report='reporting URI'` directive in the header value. You can't specify a reporting URI when block is enabled.

The metrics in the `Server-Timing` header can help you troubleshoot issues or test the efficiency of the CloudFront configuration. `server_timing_header` as defined below.
    (Optional) `enabled` - Whether to add the `Server-Timing` header in HTTP response that match a cache behavior associated with this response headers policy. Defaults to `false`.
    (Optional) `sampling_rate` - A number from 0 through 100 that specifies the percentage of responses that you want CloudFront to add the `Server-Timing` header to. When you set the sampling rate to `100`, CloudFront adds the `Server-Timing` header to the HTTP response for every request that matches the cache behavior that the response headers policy is attached to.
